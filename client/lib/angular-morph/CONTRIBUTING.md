# Contributing

### Overview

- Fork ngMorph
- Create a feature branch, namespaced by:
  - bug/...
  - feat/...
  - test/...
  - doc/...
  - refactor/...
- Make commits to your feature branch. Prefix each commit like so:
  - (feat) Added a new feature
  - (fix) Fixed inconsistent tests [Fixes #0]
  - (refactor) ...
  - (cleanup) ...
  - (test) ...
  - (doc) ...
- Make a pull request with your changes directly to master. Include a
  description of your changes.
- Wait for one of the reviewers to look at your code and either merge it or
  give feedback.
